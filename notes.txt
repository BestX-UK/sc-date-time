This sc-date-time-millis bower package is loaded as a bower dependency by the main TCA web app
so any changes to this project must be pushed to github
The process for updating the bower package will involve three primary steps:

    Make the necessary changes to your package artifact(s) (bug fixes, new features, etc, etc...whatever it might be)
    Update the bower.json file with the new version for the package
    Commit the changes
    Tag the repository
    Push your changes to git (don't forget to include the --tags switch with your push command to your remote!)

    eg:
        # commit your changes
        git commit -am "Made some awesome new changes, now its even awesomer"

        # tag the commit
        git tag -a v0.0.2 -m "Release version 0.0.2"

        # push to GitHub
        git push origin master --tags
